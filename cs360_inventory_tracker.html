        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The CS-360 Inventory Tracker is a comprehensive application designed to manage inventory efficiently using a local SQLite database. Developed in Fall 2023, the application allows users to track and manage items, providing functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting inventory records.</p>

        <h2>Enhancements Made</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Database Optimization:</strong> Improved the performance of the SQLite database by refining queries and indexing key fields. This optimization enhances the application's speed and reliability when handling large datasets.</p>
        <p><strong>2. UI Improvements:</strong> Enhanced the user interface to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. This includes a modernized design and better layout for managing inventory items.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Performance Enhancements:</strong> Optimized the application's codebase to improve overall performance. This involved refactoring code for better efficiency and responsiveness.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Throughout the enhancement process, I learned valuable lessons about database optimization and user interface design. The database optimizations significantly improved application performance, while the UI enhancements made the application more accessible to users. The challenges faced included balancing performance improvements with maintaining code readability and ensuring that UI changes did not disrupt existing functionalities. Incorporating feedback from peers helped refine the application further, addressing usability concerns and improving overall user satisfaction. This project demonstrated my ability to integrate software engineering principles with practical problem-solving skills.</p>
